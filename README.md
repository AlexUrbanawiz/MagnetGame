# Magnet Game

This is my first game ive worked on in Godot, it is pretty simple but I made it to practice building the concepts I am going to use in a game soon. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone/Download zip of the repository
2. Import into Godot
3. Run either the sample scene or the tutorial scene.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Move the mouse to move the direction the player aims the magnetic beam in.
2. Use Space Bar to change the polarity of the player
3. Use LMB to activate the magnet
4. stand on the metal pile and press 1 to decrease and 2 to increase the player's mass.
5. Press E to magnetize other objects, which gives them the player's current polarity.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Godot v4.5.1

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Replace placeholder assets with actual assets
* [ ] Create actual levels, and progression between them
* [ ] Create UI for the game
